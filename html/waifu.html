            <p>  Nazuna Nanakusa is a character from the manga and anime series Call of the Night (Yofukashi no Uta), created by
      Kotoyama. <br>
      Nazuna is a laid-back and somewhat unconventional vampire who enjoys nightlife. She has a relaxed demeanor and is
      known for her casual and nonchalant attitude. Despite her supernatural nature, she tends to lead a rather ordinary
      life, working night shifts and indulging in her love for nocturnal activities.<br>
      Nazuna meets the protagonist, Ko Yamori, who is struggling with insomnia and a sense of purposelessness in his
      life. She becomes his guide into the world of vampires and nocturnal existence. Through their interactions, she
      helps Ko explore his own desires and the mysteries of the night.<br>
      Nazuna's character is integral to the series' exploration of themes related to night life, personal freedom, and
      self-discovery. Her dynamic with Ko provides much of the series' emotional depth and intrigue.<br></p>

            <p>  Mai Sakurajima is a character from the light novel series Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai
      (commonly known as Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai), written by Hajime Kamoshida and illustrated by
      Keeji Mizoguchi. <br>
      Mai is portrayed as a beautiful and popular actress who, despite her success, struggles with feelings of
      invisibility and alienation. She is known for her calm, mature demeanor, but she also has a more vulnerable side
      that is explored throughout the series.<br>
      Mai plays a central role in the series as she becomes involved with the protagonist, Sakuta Azusagawa. The series
      starts with Mai wearing a bunny girl costume in public, which no one seems to notice, and this unusual phenomenon
      sets off a series of supernatural events linked to her emotional state. Her character's journey is deeply
      intertwined with the themes of personal struggles, relationships, and the search for identity.<br>
      Mai's story arc involves her dealing with the complexities of fame, her personal insecurities, and her evolving
      relationship with Sakuta. Her character undergoes significant development as she confronts and addresses the
      supernatural challenges affecting her life.<br></p>

The series revolves around Alya, a high school girl who often hides her true feelings by speaking in Russian, assuming no one else understands her.

  Yuki often notices how her sister interacts with the main protagonist and sometimes teases her about it. Despite this, she cares deeply for Alya and wants her to be happy.<br>
 Although Yuki is younger, she tends to be protective of Alya and can be quite perceptive, especially when it comes to noticing her sister's romantic feelings.
