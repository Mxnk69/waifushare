 Shinobu Kocho is a major character in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba and holds the title of the Insect Hashira (Pillar) in the Demon Slayer Corps. She is known for her calm, collected demeanor and unique fighting style, which sets her apart from other Hashira. 
<br>
    On the surface, Shinobu appears to be kind, cheerful, and friendly, always smiling and maintaining a pleasant attitude. She speaks softly and acts as though she holds no hatred toward demons, often appearing to be gentle even in the face of danger. However, this outward demeanor hides her deeper emotions and past traumas.

<br>
  Despite her calm exterior, Shinobu harbors a deep-seated hatred for demons. This hatred stems from the loss of her older sister, Kanae Kocho, who was killed by a demon. Shinobu hides her true feelings behind her smile and often displays a form of dark humor, which reflects her internal conflict between her cheerful persona and her anger toward demons.<br>
         Unlike other Hashira, Shinobu lacks the physical strength to decapitate demons with a sword. Instead, she uses her knowledge of poisons to kill them. Shinobu wields a specially designed sword that acts like a stinger to inject lethal wisteria-based poison into demons. This poison is fatal to demons but requires precise strikes to be effective.<br>
         Shinobu and her sister, Kanae, were orphaned at a young age after their parents were killed by demons. They were saved by a demon slayer and later decided to join the Demon Slayer Corps to prevent others from suffering the same fate. Kanae was a gentle soul who believed in the possibility of peace between humans and demons, a belief that Shinobu initially found hard to accept. After Kanae was killed by a demon, Shinobu took up her sister's sword and inherited her will, though her hatred for demons made it difficult for her to embrace her sister’s ideals fully.<br>
         Shinobu stands out for her intelligence, grace, and emotional depth. She provides a contrast to the more physically powerful Hashira by using cunning, agility, and poison to fight demons. Her layered personality, balancing cheerfulness with hidden pain, makes her a compelling and nuanced character in Demon Slayer. She represents a complex blend of strength, intelligence, and emotional conflict, making her a memorable figure in the series.

Yor Forger is a main character from the manga and anime series Spy x Family. She plays a central role in the story alongside Loid Forger (a spy) and Anya Forger (a telepathic child). Though on the surface she appears to be a gentle, soft-spoken civil servant, Yor has a secret double life as an assassin.
<br>
  Yor Forger, who also goes by the code name Thorn Princess, is a highly skilled assassin working for an underground organization. She has spent most of her life performing dangerous and lethal missions, which has made her exceptionally strong, agile, and stealthy. Despite her cold and deadly skills as an assassin, in her everyday life, Yor works as an ordinary employee in the city hall. She maintains a sweet, unassuming demeanor, and no one suspects her secret identity.



<br>
  Yor enters into a fake marriage with Loid Forger, the protagonist and a secret spy who operates under the alias "Twilight." Loid needs to create a fake family as part of his mission, and Yor needs to appear married to avoid suspicion from her colleagues, who start to question why a single woman in her late twenties is unmarried. Neither Yor nor Loid are aware of each other's secret identities—Yor doesn't know Loid is a spy, and Loid doesn't know Yor is an assassin.<br>
       In contrast to her deadly persona as an assassin, Yor is kind-hearted, shy, and sometimes socially awkward. She’s self-conscious about her lack of domestic skills, especially cooking, and often worries about appearing strange to others.
<br>
       Throughout the series, Yor’s bond with Loid and Anya becomes stronger, and while the relationship started as a cover, she begins to value her role as a mother and wife. Her development explores themes of family, acceptance, and self-worth, as she starts to realize that being part of this "fake" family gives her a sense of purpose beyond her assassin duties.<br>
        Yor Forger is a multi-faceted character—a deadly assassin known as Thorn Princess who hides her secret life behind the façade of a sweet, well-meaning civil servant. She balances her double life as a wife and mother in the Forger family, where she experiences love, protection, and warmth despite the arrangement being based on deception. Her character is both comedic and emotional, making her a fan favorite in Spy x Family.

 Hinata Hyuga is a major character in the anime and manga series Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto. She is a kunoichi (female ninja) from Konohagakure's prestigious Hyuga Clan and plays a significant role throughout the series, especially in relation to the protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki. Hinata's journey is one of personal growth, overcoming self-doubt, and developing immense inner strength.

<br> Hinata is a member of the Hyuga Clan, one of the most powerful clans in Konoha. The Hyuga Clan is known for their Byakugan, a unique dōjutsu (eye technique) that grants them enhanced vision, including a near 360-degree field of view and the ability to see the chakra pathways within others. The Byakugan also allows them to perform the Gentle Fist, a powerful taijutsu (hand-to-hand combat) style that targets the chakra network of opponents.





<br>
  Hinata is the eldest daughter of Hiashi Hyuga, the head of the clan, and as such, she was initially the heir to the main branch of the Hyuga family. However, due to her shy and gentle nature, Hinata was often viewed as weak and unsuited for leadership, causing her father to favor her younger sister, Hanabi, as the potential clan head.<br>

At the start of the series, Hinata is extremely shy, particularly around Naruto Uzumaki, whom she secretly admires. Her shyness, combined with her lack of self-confidence, makes her struggle to perform well in combat situations, especially in comparison to her more assertive peers.


<br>Hinata’s Byakugan grants her a near 360-degree field of vision (except for a small blind spot) and the ability to see long distances and detect the flow of chakra within others. This makes her an excellent tracker and gives her a significant advantage in hand-to-hand combat.
<br>Hinata Hyuga is a complex character whose story is defined by her growth from a timid and insecure girl into a strong and determined kunoichi. Her gentle nature, combined with her inner strength, makes her a unique character in the Naruto series. She is both a powerful ninja and a compassionate individual, admired for her resilience, loyalty, and unwavering love for Naruto. Through her struggles and development, Hinata becomes a symbol of how determination and kindness can lead to greatness.
